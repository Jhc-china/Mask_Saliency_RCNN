# Mask & Saliency R-CNN

This is an implementation of Mask & Saliency R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and Tensorflow. 
It's Based on Mask R-CNN ([matterport Inc. version](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)).
The model generates bounding boxes, categories, segmentation masks and saliency levels 
for each instance of an object in the Image, Using FPN and ResNet-101 backbone.
